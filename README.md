Some machine learning models from scratch in Python.

Contains:

1. Multiple linear regression (including Lasso and Ridge)

2. Logistic regression

3. SVM (hard-margin and soft-margin)

4. Neural network

5. TODO: Decision Tree

The models now support GPU acceleration, although this feature is currently experimental. It may not perform optimally on certain models. We recommend using GPU acceleration only when dealing with large datasets.
